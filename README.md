### User Stories

- First Time Visitor
    - When I visit this site I want to understand how I can interact with the website.
    - I would want to find a recipe to cook.
    - I would also consider registering an account.
- Returning Visitor
    - As a returning visitor I may be searching for the same recipe.
    - I may also now decide to register so that I can create my own recipes.
- Frequent User
    - As a frequent user I would be looking to create multiple recipes.
    - I may also be searching through other users recipes.

### Design

- Colour Scheme
    - I decided to take inspiration from 'Narutomaki' which is a topping used on ramen. This led me towards a pink and white color scheme. I chose to use blue as it was one of the triadic colours from the pink I had sampled from a picture of narutomaki.
- Typography
    - Talk About Font
- Imagery
    - In keeping with the Narutomaki theme I used this in the logo and intend to use it for some of the buttons within the website.

- Wireframes
    - I created wireframes for the basic ideas I had and then added more details as I went along.

## Features

- The website should be responsive across different devices.
- The website allows the user to find and read recipes created by themselves or by other users.

### Taking The Project Further

If I were taking the project further there are some features I believe would the website would benefit from:
- Having a favorites section so users can favorite recipes created by themselves or other users.
- More complete sharing system.
- Possibly a comment section for recipes.

- For the folder selection we selected "Root".
- The page will automatically refresh.
- Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on a GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

- Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
- Click the button and now you should have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
